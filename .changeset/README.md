# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

This folder contains a changeset file that represents changes made to this package. Changesets are used to generate a CHANGELOG and determine version bumps.

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset`. This will prompt you to:
1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Write a summary of the change

The changeset will be added to `.changeset/` directory.

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

1. Run `pnpm changeset version` to update versions and generate CHANGELOG
2. Run `pnpm build` to build the package
3. Run `pnpm changeset publish` to publish to npm

Or use the automated CI/CD workflow that handles this automatically.
